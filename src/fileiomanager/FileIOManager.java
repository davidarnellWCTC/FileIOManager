/**
 *This project is designed to have methods to read different
 * types of text based files.
 * 
 * The project is meant to be generic enough to be adaptable for different
 * uses for different applications. 
 * 
 * I had originally misunderstood the purpose of this lab and made this project
 * to work for the Mailing List lab and had to change everything around to make 
 * it more generic and usable for other projects. There are still a few changes 
 * I need to make to some classes to get this to work properly.
